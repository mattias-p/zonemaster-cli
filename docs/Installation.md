# Installation

## Overview

This document describes prerequisites, installation and post-install sanity
checking for Zonemaster::CLI. The final section wraps up with a few pointer to
other interfaces to Zonemaster. For an overview of the Zonemaster product,
please see the [main Zonemaster Repository].


## Prerequisites

Before installing Zonemaster::CLI, you should [install Zonemaster::Engine][
Zonemaster::Engine installation].

> **Note:** [Zonemaster::Engine] and [Zonemaster::LDNS] are dependencies of
> Zonemaster::CLI. Zonemaster::LDNS has a special installation requirement,
> and Zonemaster::Engine has a list of dependencies that you may prefer to
> install from your operating system distribution (rather than CPAN).
> We recommend following the Zonemaster::Engine installation instruction.

Prerequisite for FreeBSD is that the package system is upadated and activated
(see the FreeBSD section of [Zonemaster::Engine installation]).

For details on supported versions of Perl and operating system for
Zonemaster::CLI, see the [declaration of prerequisites].


## Installation

This instruction covers the following operating systems:

 * [CentOS](#1-centos)
 * [Debian](#2-debian)
 * [FreeBSD](#3-freebsd)
 * [Ubuntu](#4-ubuntu)


### 1. CentOS

Install binary dependencies:

```sh
sudo yum install perl-JSON-XS perl-Moosex-Getopt
```

Install dependencies from CPAN:

```sh
sudo cpanm Locale::Msgfmt Locale::TextDomain Text::Reflow
```

Install Zonemaster::CLI 

```sh
sudo cpanm Zonemaster::CLI
```


### 2. Debian

Install dependencies:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libmoosex-getopt-perl libtext-reflow-perl libmodule-install-perl
```

Install Zonemaster::CLI:

```sh
sudo cpanm Zonemaster::CLI
```


### 3. FreeBSD

Become root:

```sh
su -l
```

Install dependencies available from binary packages:

```sh
pkg install p5-JSON-XS p5-Locale-libintl p5-MooseX-Getopt p5-Text-Reflow
```

Install Zonemaster::CLI:

```sh
cpanm Zonemaster::CLI
```


### 4. Ubuntu

Use the procedure for installation on [Debian](#2-debian).


## Post-installation sanity check

Run the zonemaster-cli command:

```sh
zonemaster-cli --test basic zonemaster.net
```

The command is expected to take a few seconds and print some results about the delegation of zonemaster.net.


## What to do next?

 * For a web GUI, follow the [Zonemaster::Backend][Zonemaster::Backend
   installation] and [Zonemaster::GUI installation] instructions.
 * For a [JSON-RPC][JSON-RPC API] frontend, follow the [Zonemaster::Backend
   installation] instruction.
